<h1>This would be a first h1 heading</h1>
<p class="firstParagraph">Far far away, behind the word mountains, far
from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.
Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the
Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows <em>by their place and supplies it  with the necessary</em>
regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of
sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no
control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One
day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum
decided to leave for the far <a class="inText" href="">World of Grammar</a>. </p>
<h2>Here we have a h2 heading</h2>
<p>The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands
of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little
Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her
initial into the belt and made herself on the way. </p>
<p class="quote">"The quick, brown fox jumps over a lazy dog. DJs flock
by when MTV ax quiz prog. Junk MTV quiz graced by fox whelps. Bawds
jog, flick quartz, vex nymphs. Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex!
Fox nymphs grab quick-jived waltz." <span class="quote_author">immy O'Conner, 33 years.</span> </p>
<p class="quote">"Trebek's fun TV quiz game.  Woven silk pyjamas exchanged for blue quartz.  Brawny gods just." <span class="quote_author">Sara Fields, 25 years.</span> </p>
<p>When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a
last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the
headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then Sed ut
perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium

<p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like
these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am
alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created
for the bliss of souls like mine:</p>

<h2>Third h2 heading</h2>
<p><img class="imgInText" src="../img/zanzibarcropped.jpg" alt="nada" height="101" width="100">I
am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere
tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of
drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I
never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley
teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper
surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray
gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the
tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a
thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the
little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless
indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence
of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image,</p>
