<p class="fb">Whatever you think of Michael  Moore's immensely satisfying movie about the awful Bush Administration  and its destructive policies--and reasonable people can disagree, of  course--one thing that cannot be said about &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; is that  it is an outlaw from the documentary tradition. <span class="emphasize">&quot;The documentary tradition&quot;</span>  sounds like a grand phrase for a genre that includes everything from  &quot;Nanook of the North&quot; to &quot;Girls Gone Wild.&quot; There's no doubt that it's  an eclectic form. The &quot;Documentary&quot; section shelves Michael Moore next  to National Geographic, movies about bad Presidents next to movies  about butterflies, bodybuilders, and Eskimos. These movies do have one  thing in common, though: they show you what was not intended for you to  see. </p>


<p class="quote">The  essential documentary impulse is the impulse to catch life off camera,  to film what was not planned to happen, or what would have happened  whether someone was there to film it or not. That's why people make  documentaries, and why people go to see them. It's a genre founded on a  paradox. </p>

<p>The term is as old as the cinema. <span class="emphasize">Documentaire </span> was one of the names that early filmmakers, back when many of the  prominent ones were French, gave to movies of ordinary life, exotic  places, and current events. The word suggests observational neutrality,  a documentation, an unretouched record of what's real; and if that was  the promise it was betrayed almost from the start <a href="" class="fnLink">[1]</a>. The film and  television historian Erik Barnouw, in his excellent survey of the  documentary, lists a dozen cases from the early years where material  was simply faked. Finding that on film Teddy Roosevelt's charge up San  Juan Hill looked more like a hike on a hot day, producers at Vitagraph  re&euml;nacted the battle of Santiago Bay in miniature on a tabletop and  added it to what they had shot in Cuba. The British producer James  Williamson filmed the Boer War on a golf course. Thomas Edison made a  documentary of the Russo-Japanese War on Long Island. Biograph  exhibited a movie called<span class="emphasize"> &quot;The Eruption of Mount Vesuvius&quot;</span> made nowhere  near Mt. Vesuvius<a href="" class="fnLink">[2]</a>. The Danish mogul Ole Olsen produced a safari  documentary by buying a couple of aging lions from the Copenhagen zoo,  moving them to an island, and, inter-cutting stock jungle footage,  filming them being killed by hired &quot;hunters.&quot; Audiences didn't seem to  mind. </p>
