<h2>Hello this is a small accessibility test</h2>

<p><img src="../img/tree04090058.jpg" class="imgLeft" alt="This is a nice tree taken outside at Green Park in November 1965" width="307" height="230" />Accessibility is a general term used to describe the degree to which a system is  usable by as many people as possible. In other words, it is the degree  of ease with which it is possible to reach a certain location from  other locations. It is not to be confused with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability" title="Usability">usability</a> which is used to describe how easily an entity (e.g., device, service,  environment) can be used by any type of user. Accessibility can also be  viewed as the &quot;ability to access&quot; the functionality, and possible  benefit, of some system or entity; such a definition brings in  access-based individual rights laws and regulations that are discussed  below. One meaning of accessibility specifically focuses on people with  disabilities and their right of access to entities, often through use  of assistive devices such as screen-reading web browsers or  wheelchairs. Other meanings are discussed below.</p>
<p>Accessibility is strongly related to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design" title="Universal design">universal design</a> when the approach involves &quot;direct access.&quot; This is about making things  accessible to all people (whether they have a disability or not).  However, products marketed as having benefited from a Universal Design  process are often actually the same devices customized specifically for  use by people with disabilities.An alternative is to provide &quot;indirect access&quot; by having the entity  support the use of a person's assistive technology to achieve access  (e.g., screen reader).</p>
